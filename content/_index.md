# Welcome
This is the website of Andy Chatham (me). It runs on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)

## Work

I spend my working hours thinking about the future and building things with new technologies. 

### Currently: 
- Founder: [DIMO] (Digital Infrastructure for Moving Objects) 
- Consulting & Investing: Digital Infrastructure Services. 
You can find [DIMO at](https://dimo.zone/) and I'm usually on discord [here](https://discord.gg/Z9CU95umM9)

### Past Experience: 

#### I worked in 3 different roles over nearly 7 years in 5 different cities with [Transdev](https://www.transdev.com/en/)
	- GM of California, responsible for our work with [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) 
	- Director of automated shuttle projects in North America:
		- Babcock Ranch [Florida](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmcmanus/2018/10/22/in-autonomous-vehicles-future-garages-go-away-heres-10-big-re-impacts/#5855e23e4dc0)
		- 61AV [Denver](https://www.rtd-denver.com/projects/61av)
		- Olympic Park [Montreal](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/autonomous-shuttles-passenger-service-montreal)
	- Director of Product @ Transdev On-Demand

#### Before Transdev, I lived and worked in Las Vegas: 
	- First employee of [Project 100](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-04/las-vegas-of-all-places-may-be-about-to-reinvent-car-ownership) (later called SHIFT) an early Mobility-as-a-Service company. We built a 1MW EV Charging Hub, which at the time was the largest in the world. 
	- I helped build the [Zappos.com HQ](https://officesnapshots.com/2013/12/16/new-zappos-downtown-las-vegas-headquarters/) and some other office spaces in downtown Las Vegas. I went toe-to-toe with the payphone king of Las Vegas and lived to tell the tale. 

#### I got my start in the business world at Cornell in Ithaca New York in 2009, when Andy Bernard was at peak popularity. [Ever heard of it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKSti1O0Bio)
