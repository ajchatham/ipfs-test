### Experience: 
I founded of [Digital Infrastructure Inc.](https://drivedimo.com) a technology and services firm that connects the digital and physical world to produce useful work.  

This company incubated [DIMO](https://dimo.zone), the leading user-owned connected vehicle network. 


#### I worked for [Transdev](https://www.transdev.com/en/) in 3 different roles over 7 years in 5 different cities. 
- GM of California, responsible for our work with [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) 
- Director of automated shuttle projects in North America:

- I helped build the [Zappos.com HQ](https://officesnapshots.com/2013/12/16/new-zappos-downtown-las-vegas-headquarters/) and some other office spaces in downtown Las Vegas. I went toe-to-toe with the payphone king of Las Vegas and lived to tell the tale.
